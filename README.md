# ps-webpage
```
this is a webpage that emulates what a page from the public safety department from the Chainsaw Man manga could look like.
It is a project i developed to practice my vue3 skills.
I also used the json-server package to simulate fetching data from a database, which is the teamDB.json file in the data folder.
You can preview this project here: https://chainsaw-man-public-safety.vercel.app/
